- Just show my experiments on NLL and polonius
	- I'm trying to simulate NLL in datalog style, take the `nll-facts` as input
	- I implement two set of rules: polonius/nll, polonius/nllinsensitive, follow the NLL rfc
		- https://github.com/lengyijun/polonius/tree/nll
	- polonius/nll works better than polonius/location-insensitive, but not as good as polonius/naive
		- because polonius/nll doesn't deal with loan_killed_at
	- polonius/nllinsensitive outputs the same result as polonius/location-insensitive
	- moreover, I compare polonius/nllinsensitive and NLL in rustc
		- both of them are location insensitive
		- I'm little sad that they at not equivalent
			- if they are equivalent, I can do some formal work on relation between them
		- in most cases, they output the same result
		- except this example
		- ```
		  fn main(){
		      let mut x = 22;
		  let mut y = 44;
		  let mut p: &u32 = &x; // Loan L0, borrowing `x`
		  y += 1;                  // (A) Mutate `y` -- is this ok?
		  let mut q: &u32 = &y; // Loan L1, borrowing `y`
		  if true {
		      p = &y;               // `p` now points at `y`
		      x += 1;              // (B) Mutate `x` -- is this ok?
		  } else {
		      y += 1;              // (C) Mutate `y` -- is this ok?
		  }
		      p;
		  }
		  
		  ```
			- datalog version give an error while rustc doesn't
			- I'm not familiar with the implementation detail of NLL, and I guess NLL has some special deal with borrow/reborrow
